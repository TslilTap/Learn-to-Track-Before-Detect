# Learn-to-Track-Before-Detect
"I love being wrong because that means in that instance, I learned something new that day"


The track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm can enhance radar
detection and tracking of weak targets in the presence of noise
and clutter. However, TBD gives rise to challenges in com-
putational complexity and reliance on precise mathematical
descriptions of the measurement model. This work presents a
TBD algorithm combining dynamic programming and deep
learning, augmenting the Viterbi algorithm with a dedicated
deep neural network (DNN) to address these challenges. Our
method alleviates the computational complexity by imple-
menting state-aware pruning while bypassing an explicit use
of a measurement model by utilizing a DNN. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using physically
compliant Range-Doppler measurements.
